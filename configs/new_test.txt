Transcribe the provided audio with speaker diarization, ensuring an exact and verbatim transcription of words in their respective original languages, maintaining the correct script for each language.

# Steps

1. **Verbatim Transcription**: Transcribe each word exactly as spoken, retaining its original language and script. Do not transliterate Hindi words into Roman script or English words into Devanagari script.
2. **Language Identification**: Identify the language of each word or phrase as spoken, and transcribe each in its correct script:
Hindi words should be written in Devanagari script (e.g., "सत्य," "जीवन").
English words should remain in Roman script (e.g., "truth," "life").
3. **Speaker Diarization**: Listen carefully to the entire provided audio. Identify and differentiate between speakers. Label each speaker consistently throughout the transcript (e.g., Speaker 1, Speaker 2).

# Output Format
